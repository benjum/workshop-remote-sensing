# Introduction to Remote Sensing with Python

<img src="images/remote2.png" width=600>

Satellites are circling our planet, allowing us to "sense" things about the Earth. It is the art and science of making measurements using sensors. Remote sensing has thus become a valuable tool in research and applications in a wide range of disciplines, such as engineering, geology, geography, urban planning, public health, archeology, environmental studies, disaster research, forestry, and agriculture.

In this workshop, you will:

- learn the basic principles of remote sensing methods in research
- have a hands-on session on using Jupyter Notebooks to code in Python
- import Landsat imagery using Google Earth Engine's Python library
- conduct a basic NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis

While there are no prerequisites to take this workshop, participants are encouraged to come with a Google Earth Engine account, which can be obtained here:
